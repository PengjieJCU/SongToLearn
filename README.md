> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  about 2 weeks
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
... I learned about Class and GUI. In the process of doing assignment 2, I learned how to use the Class and GUI. These two problems always make me very confuse, but now I understand and know how to use them, how to combine with Class and GUI(kivy).

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...I still confuse how to sort the songs by (title, artist, year and is_required) and why we need the test_song and test_songlist.


## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...I think the add songs, clean inputs of user, create widgets to show the song list, formatted song, user click the song and the song is marked learned and change the color of button. These parts are work well in my development process.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...I think I will improve three parts, which are sorting the songs, testing_song and test_songlist.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
...I mainly use the KivyDemos-Master file and run each app, then I observe the each app and find the functions I need in the assignment 2. And write my code according to these templates.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... sort songs, create widgets, add songs and the changing of color of the buttons.
